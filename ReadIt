Hey thanks for checking out this..


In the above project I have used OOPS concepts like, 
          1. Polymirphism
          2. Abstraction
          3. Inheritance
and constructor and some other basic concepts. 

If you are beginner with JAVA and oops concepts and you want to build a project
then thia will be an amazing excercise for you to understand the concepts more clearly.

Along with the oops concepts you will understand the real world use for basic concepts in a programming language. 

Please check out others projects too...


Happy Coding...<3 <3.
